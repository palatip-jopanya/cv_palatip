          <h5 class="name"> Biography</h5>
          <p class="paragraph1">My full name is Palatip Jopanya. My nickname is John, which is derived from the Chinese character "çº¦ç¿°:John" and is pronounced "Yorn" in Thai. I was born in the Thai province of Chiang Mai, which is located in the northern part of the country. My family follows the Christian faith. I was born to a single sister as a younger brother. Like the other kids, I enjoy going on excursions, swimming, hiking, fishing, and playing with my pals while I'm young. In the past, I've discovered that I enjoy disassembling and reassembling electronic toys, finding what make it work inside. Starting in high school, I shifted my concentration to my studies, devoting less time to fun and more time to studying, much like the other children who were subjected to parental pressure. I was eventually admitted into the City University's Electrical Engineering program. While studying engineering, I am fascinated by the world of computer technology. One thing that I will never forget about my studies is the project that I completed under the guidance of my favorite instructor, which focused on a digital image processing application for Android. Following graduation, I chose to work at a telecommunications firm because it is the only job that fits my preferences and offers limited chances in Thailand. In the workplace, time passes (quickly). My working chronology has followed the advancement of wireless telecommunications from 3G to 4G to 5G. One of the most important lessons I've taken away from this job is that firm fundamentals are essential for learning new technologies, solving challenges, and deploying applications in any job. I'm pleased I've been putting in the effort to learn the foundations so that I may have a clear understanding of the technological domain. I hope that in the future, with the help of technology, the world will be a better place to live, and I am really excited for the future technology. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my biography.
